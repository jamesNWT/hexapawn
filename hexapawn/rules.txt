Rules of hexapawn:
1. The pieces move like pawns from chess.
2. You win by either:
	A) capturing all enemy pieces
	B) advancing a piece to the other end of the board
	C) moving a piece so that your opponent has no legal moves
Help with this implementation of hexapawn:
1. This program uses text in the console to "draw" the board
2. Your pieces are represented by O, the opponent's by X
3. you enter moves similar to how moves are recorded in chess. 
   simply enter the coordinate of the piece you'd like to move and 
   the coordinate you'd like to move it to, seperated by a dash.
   eg: a1-a2 would be a valid opening move for the player with the 
   "O" pieces.
4. I recommend you make sure your console has a width of at least 
   25 characters to make sure the board displays properly.
5. The computer learns to play over multiple games by keeping track 
   of what moves lost it the game. It starts out making random moves
   but but will eventually never lose!
6. If you start a new game before training the AI, you can watch it 
   improve over the course of a series of games. If you want to play
   against an AI that I'm pretty sure is unbeatable, train the AI 
   before playing it by entering "t" when the options prompt comes 
   up.
