# hexapawn
a simple hexapawn game that runs in the console.

Hexapawn wasn't created to be fun but to demonstrate a very simple case of reinforcement learning.
I implemented it as a way to try out C++ and have a starting point for a chess engine and trying 
my own expirements in AI.

Video about hexapawn, that explains the game and is where I got the inspiration for this project from:

things I'd like to do with this in the future:
- Implement another AI algorithm
- Add a proper GUI
- Write a full chess engine?!?!
